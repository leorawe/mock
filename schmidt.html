              <h2>Top Issues: </h2>
              <p>As a <a href="#write">write-in candidate</a> for Middlesex County Board of Commissioners, these are
                some of the issues I will address.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><span class="mock-issue">Caring About One Another:</span> it is easy to view someone as a statistic.
                Instead, we need to view each person as a member of our community. A person wants his or her
                opinion heard, whether is it is sickness, poverty, employment opportunities, or
                immigration. I will listen to a person's invidual problems and work to find a grass roots solution.</li>
                <li><span class="mock-issue">Lower Taxes:</span> there are multiple ways to cut costs. I will work our legislature to find ways to lower the budget.</span></li>
                <li><span class="mock-issue">Public Relations with the Police:</span> part of living in society is getting along with each other.
                Sometimes individual people make this difficult.  Police and sheriffs have a responsibility to maintain
                law and order. Police and civilians need to treat each other with respect. One should
                not assume wrongdoing unless there is evidence. </li>
                <li><span class="mock-issue">Medical Freedom:</span> A person should be able
                to decide with his or her doctor the best course of action for the individual.
                The government should not be involved, controlling, or coercing individual health decisions.</li>
                <li><span class="mock-issue">Support Local Business</span></li>
                <li><span class="mock-issue">Environment:</span> We need to figure out a
                balance betweent taking care of waste and pollution and living in the modern world.
                Such a balance is not easy and is a work in progress.</li>

              </ul>
              <p>We are all a work in progress. I will listen to the individual citizen and study new information, scientific and legal, and use that knowledge to help the citizens. </p>
